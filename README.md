# Symfony Standard Edition

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webplates/symfony-standard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/webplates/symfony-standard)

> Welcome to the Symfony Standard Edition - a fully-functional Symfony2
> application that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

Well, this is not the original one, but still welcome to it. This is "my" Symfony Standard Edition.

The rationale behind creating a custom skeleton is simple:
put some extra logic in it which could still be required by any application which people might create.
This includes, but is not limited to the following:

 - Deployment tools
 - Development tools
 - Best practices

**Important:** This is not a fork. Although this version is created based on the original one, it does not
have any connection to it. From time to time the content might be updated in order to adhere the latest-greatest
practices.

If you are looking for the original version, you can find it [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard).
However I suggest continue reading first as you might find a few interesting features you might want to use.

This skeleton does not try to force you to use any of the included features, thus a *How to remove/add back?* section is
added to the end of each feature documentation.
