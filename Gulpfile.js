/*
 gulpfile.js
 ===========
 Rather than manage one giant configuration file responsible
 for creating multiple tasks, each task has been broken out into
 its own file in gulp/tasks.
 To add a new task, simply add a new task file that directory.
 gulp/tasks/default.js specifies the default set of tasks to run
 when you run `gulp`.
